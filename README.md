Overview
Face recognition (FR) is one the most widely known and used non-intrusive biometric which helps in identifying people. Given the identity of a known person, the goal of an FR system is to recognize the same person in a different scenario, for example while displaying a different expression. You can read this paper to understand more about FR under different expressions.

Your task is to help the researchers in analysing eight geodesic (surface) and eight 3D Euclidian distances between a few facial landmarks across four expressions 'Neutral', 'Angry', 'Disgust', 'Happy'. These distances on one face (in Neutral expression) can then be used to calculate similarity with the same face in different expressions or with other faces in the data set to see which faces are closer to (or look like) the reference face.
